    "The Kraut method finds decomposition of a matrix as $A=LU$ where $L$ is the lower triangular and $U$ is the upper triangular matrix. We can assume that all the diagonal elements of $L$ are equal to $1$. Once we know the matrices, it is easy to calculate the determinant of $A$; it is equal to the product of all the elements on the main diagonal of the matrix $U$.\n",

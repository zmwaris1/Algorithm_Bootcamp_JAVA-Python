    "What is GCD? Given two non-negative integers a and b the largest number which is a divisor of both $a$ and $b$ is known as GCD of $a$ and $b$. It is commonly denoted as $gcd(a, b)$. When one of the number is zero, the GCD by definition is the second number. When both the numbers are zero, their GCD is undefined, but can be said to be zero. "

    "The $n^{th}$ Fibonacci number can be easily found in $O(n)$ by computing numbers one-by-one up to $n$. However, there are also faster ways, which we will see:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Closed-form expression\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a formula known as \"Binet's Formula\", which can be used to calculate a Fibonacci number:\n",
    "\n",
    "## $ F_{n} = \\frac{(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2})^{n} - \\frac{(1-\\sqrt{5})}{2}^{n}}{\\sqrt{5}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is observed that the second term's value is always less than 1, and it also decreases very rapidly. Hence by deducing the second term we are left with the equation as:\n",
    "\n",
    "## $ F_{n} = [\\frac{(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2})^{n}}{\\sqrt{5}}$]\n",
    "\n",
    "where the square brackets indicate rounding to the nearest integer. But since these formulas require very high accuracy when working with Frational numbers so they used less in practical calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Matrix Form\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to prove the relation:\n",

    "$ (F_{n-1} \\; F_{n}) = (F_{n-2} \\; F_{n-1}) * \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\\n",

    "So tackle this problem there is an easy fix where we can just compute two different hashes for each string(by using two different $p$ and $m$) and then compare these pairs. Now if is about $10^{9}$ for each hash function, then the probability of a collision happening is combined to be $10^{18}$ which is better even when we use a greater number of strings."

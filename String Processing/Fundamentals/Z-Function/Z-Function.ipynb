Note that in the end, if $z[i] > 0$ we'll have to update the indices of the rightmost segment, because it's guaranteed that the new $r = i+z[i]-1$ is better than the previous $r$.\n",

Then we can use the already calculated Z-values to \"initialize\" the value of $z[i]$ to something(it sure is better than \"starting from zero\"), maybe even some big number. For this, we observe that the substrings $s[l..r]$ and $s[0...r-l]$ match. This means that as an initial approximation for $z[i]$ we can take the value already computed for the corresponding segement $s[0....r-l]$, and that is $z[i-l]$.\n",

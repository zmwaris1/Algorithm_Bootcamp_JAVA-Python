    "It is well known that you can find the shortest paths between a single source and all other vertices in $O(|E|)$ using BFS in an unweighted graph, i.e, the distance is the minimal number if edges that you need to traverse from the source to another vertex. We can interpret such a graph also as a weighted graph, where every edge has the weight $1$. If not all edges in the graph have the same weight, then we need a more general algorithm like Dijkstra which runs in $O(|V|^{2} + |E|)$ or $O(|E|log|V|)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the weights are more constrained we can often do better. In this article we will see how we can use BFS to solve the single source smallest path problem in $O(|E|)$, if the weights of each edge is either $0$ or $1$."

    "We can develop the algorithm by closely studying Dijkstra's algorithm and think about the consequences that our special graph implies. We notice that the difference between the distances between the source $s$ and two other vertices in a queue differs by at most one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially we know that $d[v] \\leq d[u] \\leq d[v] + 1$ for each $u \\in Q$. The reason for this is that we only add vertices with equal distance or with distance plus one to the queue each iteration. Assuming there exists a $u$ in the queue with $d[u] - d[v] > 1$, then $u$ must have been insert in the queue via a different vertex $t$ with $d[t] \\geq d[u] -1 > d[v]$. However this is impossible, since Dijkstra iterates over the vertices in increasing order.\n",

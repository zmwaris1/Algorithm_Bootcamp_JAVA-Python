    "<b>Proof</b>: Consider an arbitrary vertex $a$ to which there is a path from the starting vertex $v$, and consider a shortest path to it $(p_{0} = v, p_{1},..., p_{k} = a)$. Before the first phase, the shortest path to the vertex $p_{0} = v$ was found correctly. During the first phase, the edge $(p_{0}, p_{r})$ has been checked by the algorithm, and therefore, the distance to the vertex $p_{1}$ was correctly calculated after the first phase. Repeating the statement $k$ times, we see that after $k-th$ phase the distance to the vertex $p_{k} = a$ gets calculated correctly, which we wanted to prove. \n",
    "\n",

    "#### The case of negative cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "In the presence of a negative cycle(s), there are further complications associated with the fact that distances to all vertices in this cycle, as well as the distances to the vertices reachable from this cycle is not defined - they should be equal to minus infinity $-\\infty$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to see that the algorithm can endlessly do the relaxation among all vertices of this cycle and the vertices reachable fro it. Therefore, if you do not limit the number of phases to $n-1$, the algorithm will run indefinitely, constantly improving the distance from these vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence we obtain the criterin for presence of a cycle of negative weights reachable for source vertex $v$; after $(n-1)th$ phase. If we run algorithm for one more phase, and it performs at least one more relaxation, then the graph contains a negative weight cycle that is reachable from $v$; otherwise such a cycle does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover if such a cycle is found, the algorithm can be amodified so that it retrieves this cycle as a sequence of vertices contained in it. For this, it is sufficient to remember the last vertex $x$ for which there is a relaxation in $n-th$ phase. This vertex will either lie in a negative weight cycle, or is reachable from it. To get the vertices that are guaranteed to lie in a negative cycle, starting from the vertex $x$, pass through to the predecessors $n$ times. Hence we will get the vertex $y$, namely the vertex in the cycle earliest reachable from source. We have to go from this vertex, throught the predecessors until we get back to the same vertex $y$."

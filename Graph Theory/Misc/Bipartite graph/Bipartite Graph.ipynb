    "Let's use a series of BFSs, starting from each vertex which has not been visited yet. In each search assign the vertex from which we start to side 1. Each time we visit a yet unvisited neighbour of a vertex assigned to one side, we assign it to the other side. When we try to go to a neighbour of a vertex assigned to one side which has already been visited, we check that it has been already been visited, we check that it has been assigned to the other side, if it has been assigned to the same side, we conclude that the graph is not bipartite. Once we've visited all vertices and successfully assigned them to sides, we know that the graph is bipartite and we have constructed it's partitioning."

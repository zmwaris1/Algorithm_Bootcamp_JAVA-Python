    "It initially places all the nodes of the original graph isolated from each other, to form a forest of single node trees, and then gradually merge these trees, combining at each iteration any two of all trees with some edge of the original graph. Before the execution of the algorithm, all edges are sorted by weight (in increasing order).Then begins the process of unification, pick all edges from the first to the last and if the ends of the currently picked edge belong to different subtrees, these subtrees are combined and the edge is added to the answer. After iterating through all the edges, all the vertices will belong to the same subtree and we will get the answer."
